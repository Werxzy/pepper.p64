add none option?

test include command

add infinite loop check on include
	check if file is included 3 times, then exit
	specifically 3 because there could be some small weird cases where a file could include itself for some benifit

improve ui
	
add option to remove startup


--probably not possible yet--

keybind if possible??? (like ctrl+r)

.pepper syntax highlighting?
	code.p64 doesn't automatically give it lua's, so it might be possible?
